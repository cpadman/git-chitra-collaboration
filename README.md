# GIT Notes

- 'git clone <URL>': downloads the repo from the web to local.
	- make sure you don't nest this command in another repo
	- just like git init do this only once per repo

- git switch- switch to new branch
- git checkout - old way to switch to new branch
- git branch - create new branch
- git switch -c <branch name> - create and switch in one command
- git stash: temp saves current state
